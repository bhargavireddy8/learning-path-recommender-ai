# Learning Path Recommender (AI Project)

## Overview
The Learning Path Recommender is an AI-based system that helps learners choose the right courses
by analyzing their current skills, learning goals, and available time.
It generates a personalized learning roadmap instead of random course suggestions.

## Problem Statement
Students and self-learners often get confused by thousands of online courses.
There is no clear guidance on what to learn next or which prerequisites are required.

## Solution
This project recommends a structured learning path by:
- Identifying skill gaps
- Matching prerequisites
- Suggesting courses in the correct order
- Creating a time-based learning plan

## Features
- Skill gap analysis
- Personalized learning roadmap
- Course prerequisite mapping
- Weekly learning plan
- Progress tracking

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit
